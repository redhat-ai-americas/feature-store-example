Feature Services for Simplified AWS Insurance Demo Architecture.

This simplified architecture provides feature services for latency testing with:
- 1 batch feature view (customer_consolidated_features) with variable feature counts
- 1 on-demand feature view (premium_calculator_optimized)

The services are designed to enable comprehensive latency testing by:
1. Variable feature count testing (5, 10, 20, 40 features)
2. ODFV overhead measurement (with/without premium calculator)
3. Performance comparison and bottleneck identification

Simplified Architecture Feature Services Summary:

LATENCY TESTING SERVICES:
1. customer_5_features -> customer_40_features: Variable batch FV latency (5-40 features)
2. customer_5_with_premium -> customer_40_with_premium: Variable + ODFV latency
3. customer_baseline: Pure batch FV (40 features, no ODFV)
4. premium_only: Minimal ODFV test (3 + 8 features)

PRODUCTION SERVICES:
1. quick_quote: 13 features, <50ms SLA
2. standard_quote: 18 features, <100ms SLA
3. comprehensive_quote: 48 features, <200ms SLA

TESTING CAPABILITY:
- Feature count scaling: 5 -> 10 -> 20 -> 40 features
- ODFV overhead: Compare with/without premium calculator
- Bottleneck identification: Batch FV vs ODFV transformation
- Performance regression: Compare against baselines

EXPECTED LATENCIES (targets):
- customer_5_features: ~10-15ms (batch only)
- customer_5_with_premium: ~20-30ms (batch + ODFV)
- customer_40_features: ~30-50ms (large batch)
- customer_40_with_premium: ~40-60ms (large batch + ODFV)
