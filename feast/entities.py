"""
Entity definitions for the AWS Insurance Demo - Simplified Architecture.

This simplified architecture focuses on customer-centric features for latency testing.
Only the customer entity is retained to support:
- 1 batch feature view (customer_consolidated_features)
- 1 on-demand feature view (premium_calculator_optimized)

Original entities (policy, claim, provider, transaction) have been removed
as part of the architecture simplification.
